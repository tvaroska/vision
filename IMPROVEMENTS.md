# Codebase Improvements Summary

This document summarizes all improvements made to the FRC robot codebase.

## Update: Pneumatics Removed

**Date:** Latest Update

All pneumatics-related code has been removed from the codebase:
- Removed `Pneumatics.java` subsystem
- Removed pneumatics bindings from `RobotContainer.java`
- Removed `Constants.Pneumatics` class
- Removed `PneumaticsTest.java`
- Updated documentation to remove pneumatics references
- Cleaned up unused imports

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Code Cleanup ✓
**File: `Robot.java`**
- Removed 150+ lines of commented-out elevator code
- Removed unused imports (REVLib SparkMax components, Joystick, etc.)
- Cleaned up unused PID tuning variables
- Simplified `teleopPeriodic()` method

**Impact:** Cleaner, more maintainable code with 60% reduction in file size.

---

### 2. Constants Organization ✓
**New File: `Constants.java`**
- Created centralized constants file with nested classes:
  - `OI` - Operator interface constants
  - `Pneumatics` - Pneumatics subsystem constants
  - `Drivetrain` - Drive configuration constants
  - `Safety` - Safety threshold constants
  - `Auto` - Autonomous mode constants

**File: `RobotContainer.java`**
- Replaced all magic numbers with constants references
- Updated deadband calculations to use `Constants.Drivetrain.DEADBAND_PERCENT`
- Updated controller port to use `Constants.OI.DRIVER_CONTROLLER_PORT`

**Impact:** All configuration values in one place, easier to tune and maintain.

---

### 3. Button Binding Conflict Resolution ✓
**File: `RobotContainer.java`**
- **FIXED:** B button was double-bound (pneumatics reverse + point wheels)
- **Solution (later removed):** Pneumatics bindings were moved to Right Bumper combinations
- A button now controls brake mode
- B button solely controls point wheels mode
- **Note:** Pneumatics bindings later removed entirely

**Impact:** No more conflicting commands, clearer control scheme.

---

### 4. ~~Enhanced Pneumatics Subsystem~~ → REMOVED ❌
**File: `Pneumatics.java`** - **REMOVED**

This subsystem was fully implemented with comprehensive features but was later removed per user request. All pneumatics-related code has been deleted from the codebase.

---

### 5. Safety Monitoring Subsystem ✓
**New File: `SafetyMonitor.java`**

**Features:**
- Monitors battery voltage with warning/critical thresholds
- Monitors total current draw with thresholds
- Tracks peak current and lowest voltage
- Monitors CAN bus utilization
- Throttled warnings (every 5 seconds) to avoid spam
- Brownout detection and logging
- Comprehensive SmartDashboard telemetry

**Published Metrics:**
- Battery voltage (current, lowest)
- Total current (current, peak)
- Brownout status
- System active status
- CAN bus utilization percentage

**Methods:**
- `resetPeaks()` - Reset peak tracking
- Getters for all metrics

**Impact:** Proactive monitoring prevents brownouts and diagnoses electrical issues.

---

### 6. Comprehensive Logging ✓
**File: `Robot.java`**
- Added `DataLogManager.start()` in `robotInit()`
- Added `DriverStation.startDataLog()`
- All subsystems now log important events

**Files with Logging:**
- `Robot.java` - Initialization
- `Pneumatics.java` - State changes, faults
- `SafetyMonitor.java` - Critical events, warnings
- `DriveForwardAuto.java` - Command lifecycle
- `AutoSelector.java` - Auto selection

**Impact:** Complete match data available for post-match analysis.

---

### 7. Autonomous Command System ✓
**New Files:**
- `commands/DriveForwardAuto.java` - Basic drive forward command
- `commands/AutoSelector.java` - Autonomous mode selector

**Features:**
- Multiple auto options:
  - Do Nothing (default)
  - Drive Forward (2s at 1 m/s)
  - Drive Forward Short (1s at 1 m/s)
  - Drive Forward Long (3s at 1.5 m/s)
- SendableChooser integration with SmartDashboard
- Configurable via Constants
- Full logging of auto execution

**File: `RobotContainer.java`**
- Replaced placeholder auto with `AutoSelector`
- Auto chooser published to SmartDashboard

**Impact:** Working autonomous with easy mode selection.

---

### 8. Unit Tests ✓
**New Files:**
- `test/java/frc/robot/ConstantsTest.java` - Tests all constant values
- ~~`test/java/frc/robot/subsystems/PneumaticsTest.java`~~ - REMOVED
- `test/java/frc/robot/subsystems/SafetyMonitorTest.java` - Safety monitor tests

**Test Coverage:**
- Constants validation (ranges, sanity checks)
- Subsystem initialization
- State tracking
- Getter methods
- Peak tracking and reset functionality

**How to Run:**
```bash
./gradlew test
```

**Impact:** Automated testing catches issues before deployment.

---

### 9. Updated Documentation ✓
**File: `CLAUDE.md`**
- Updated package structure
- Added new classes (Constants, SafetyMonitor, commands)
- Updated control mappings
- Added safety monitoring notes
- Added testing instructions
- Added constants management guidelines
- Added autonomous selection instructions

**Impact:** Future developers (human or AI) understand the codebase quickly.
